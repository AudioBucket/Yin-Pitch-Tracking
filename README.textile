h1. Yin Pitch Tracking

"YIN algorithm":http://audition.ens.fr/adc/pdf/2002_JASA_YIN.pdf is a popular algorithm for tracking pitch (or the fundamental frequecy) of a monophonic audio signal. This project is an implementation of the Yin algorithm in C, suitable for embedded systems.

The code was ported to C from C++ from the "The Pidato Experiment":https://github.com/JorenSix/Pidato. The Pidato project was originally written for the Arduino platform, hence the C++. This is an attempt to port the algorithm implemented in the Pidato project to a more generic module, as most large embedded systems tend to lean more towards C (yeah I know you can do some tricky building and make it work but ain't nobody got time for that!)
